    "In this project we took different data that was taken of the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh to find out the best one. We used a few unique datasets to analyze which neighborhoods are the better ones. We used a dataset of historic sites that help us know which neighborhood gets more tourism and attention. Another dataset was measuring the air quality of the neighborhoods and the best air quality would have a better possibility of good health. We also had dog licenses as a dataset that was measured by the possibility of the neighborhood being walkable. Finally, our last data set was on determining the waste recovery locations, which was measured by the neighborhood that had the most recovery locations. "
